# gif cabinet

*gif cabinet* is multiple things. It's an idea inspired by my ridiculous squad's Facebook chat where GIFs are sent back and forth on the reg. It's a way for me to learn React. It's an excuse for me to look at GIFs.

## Usage

1. Log in to your own personal *gif cabinet* using Facebook at [https://martellaj.github.io/gif-cabinet/](https://martellaj.github.io/gif-cabinet/).
2. Start adding GIFs you love to use regularly, and make sure to tag them properly so you can find them easily in the future.
3. Come back later when you want that perfect GIF response and search your own collection of curated GIFs to quickly find the best response.

## Development

1. Clone this repo.
2. Using *npm*, run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you want to be cool) followed by `npm run start` to quickly get a dev server up and running.
